# WeatherAPI-Py
 WeatherAPI-Py 🌍☁️ - A Python Package for Fetching Air Temperature WeatherAPI-Py is a Python package that allows users to retrieve real-time air temperature data using multiple weather APIs, including Open-Meteo and OpenWeather. This package provides an easy-to-use interface for fetching and processing temperature data using latitude and longitude coordinates.  🌟 Features ✅ Support for multiple weather APIs (Open-Meteo & OpenWeather) ✅ Object-oriented architecture with a base class for easy extension ✅ Conversion from Kelvin to Celsius for OpenWeather API ✅ Lightweight and simple to use  🚀 Installation bash Copy Edit pip install weatherapi-py 📌 Usage python Copy Edit from weatherapi import OpenMeteo, OpenWeather  # Using Open-Meteo open_meteo = OpenMeteo(35.6944, 51.4215) temperature = open_meteo.get_current_temperature() print(f"Temperature from Open-Meteo: {temperature}°C")  # Using OpenWeather (requires API key) open_weather = OpenWeather(35.6944, 51.4215, api_key="your_api_key") temperature = open_weather.get_current_temperature() temperature = open_weather.kelvin_to_celsius(temperature) print(f"Temperature from OpenWeather: {temperature}°C") 📜 License This project is licensed under the MIT License.
